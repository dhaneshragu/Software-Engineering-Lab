# Linear Search Application

Welcome to the Linear Search Application! This simple visual basic windows application allows you to read a list of elements from a file containing elements of any data-type and perform a linear search to find a specific element.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Ensure that you have Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate installed on your system.
- Download the source code project `LinearSearch`.
- Open the project in Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate.

### Usage

- Run the windows application in Visual Studio by clicking the `Run` button or `F5`.
- In the GUI that comes up, click the  `Open File` button and upload the `.txt` file containing the input list elements.
- Make sure that each element is in a separate line in the text file.
- Enter the target element to be searched in the textbox and get the output in a pop-up message.
- Watch the visualisation highlighting as the search proceeds to understand the working of algorithm.

### Results

- The program will perform a linear search and inform you whether the element is found and, if so, at which index using a popup message.


### Note

- The implementation gives the first index of occurence of the target if found.
- The implementation considers the case while matching string elements. Eg: Hello and hello are treated different.
- Feel free to see the inline comments and technical documentation for more detailed explanation.
